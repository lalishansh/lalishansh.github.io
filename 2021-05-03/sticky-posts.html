<p>Sticky, or pinned, posts are featured on the top of every page. blacklily provides some flexibility when it comes to this feature.<!--more--> There is no limit on the number of sticky posts you can have. Although do note that each page will show all your sticky posts + the paginated posts. So if you have 4 sticky posts and 5 posts per page, each page can display up to 9 posts.</p>
